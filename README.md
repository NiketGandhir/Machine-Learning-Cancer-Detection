# Machine Learning Cancer Detection
About this Machine Learning Model -

```
The primary aim of this Machine Learning Model is to segregate tumors as either malignant (invading tumor)
or benign (non-invading tumor) among breast cancer patients.

This Machine Learning Model was developed in Python using Spyder IDE, and it utilizies the following libraries - 
numpy, panda, and matplotlib.
```
Data Set -
```
The data-set used in this model is available publicly at UCI Machine Learning Repositry and was created by Dr. William H Wolberg, 
physician at University of Wisconsin Hospital. To create this data-set, doctors and pathologists analyzed the samples obtained 
from the patients and classified them with different textures, radius, smoothness, compactness and symmetry.

```
This model is successful to a great extent, with an accuracy of AUC 0.965. However, the accuracy isn't its major advantage
over pathalogists. The major advantage is that it is more effective, consistent, and less inclined to make mistakes.
